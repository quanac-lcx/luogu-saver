# Judgement System Specification

## 1. Scope

The judgement system integrates the Luogu judgement history into the main Luogu Saver backend and frontend. It owns persistence, fixed-interval synchronization, public read APIs, administrator-controlled history hiding, and one-time import of the legacy SQLite database.

The legacy Express server, legacy static pages, the legacy SQLite runtime, and browser requests to `jdmt.luogu.me` are outside the integrated runtime.

## 2. Persistence

### 2.1 Judgement Record

Table name: `judgement_record`.

| Column               | Type         | Constraints      | Description                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                 | INT UNSIGNED | PRIMARY KEY      | Record identifier                           |
| `dedup_key`          | CHAR(64)     | UNIQUE, NOT NULL | Stable SHA-256 duplicate key                |
| `uid`                | INT UNSIGNED | NOT NULL         | Luogu user ID                               |
| `name`               | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL         | User name captured with the event           |
| `reason`             | TEXT         | NULLABLE         | Judgement reason                            |
| `revoked_permission` | INT UNSIGNED | DEFAULT 0        | Revoked permission bit set                  |
| `added_permission`   | INT UNSIGNED | DEFAULT 0        | Added permission bit set                    |
| `time`               | INT UNSIGNED | NOT NULL         | Luogu event time in Unix seconds            |
| `user_snapshot`      | JSON         | NOT NULL         | Complete user object returned by Luogu      |
| `full_record`        | JSON         | NOT NULL         | Complete judgement object returned by Luogu |
| `fetch_log_id`       | INT UNSIGNED | NOT NULL         | Fetch that first persisted this record      |
| `created_at`         | DATETIME     | NOT NULL         | Local persistence time                      |

The duplicate key SHALL be the lowercase hexadecimal SHA-256 digest of the JSON array `[uid, time, reason ?? "", revokedPermission, addedPermission]`.

The table SHALL index `(time, id)`, `(uid, time, id)`, and `fetch_log_id`. When the duplicate key already exists, synchronization SHALL preserve the first persisted snapshots and fetch-log association.

### 2.2 Fetch Log

Table name: `judgement_fetch_log`.

| Column             | Type         | Constraints                 | Description                       |
| ------------------ | ------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `id`               | INT UNSIGNED | PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT | Fetch identifier                  |
| `fetched_at`       | DATETIME     | NOT NULL                    | Fetch completion time             |
| `record_count`     | INT UNSIGNED | NOT NULL                    | Valid records returned by Luogu   |
| `new_record_count` | INT UNSIGNED | DEFAULT 0                   | Newly inserted records            |
| `skipped_count`    | INT UNSIGNED | DEFAULT 0                   | Duplicate records skipped         |
| `status`           | VARCHAR(16)  | `success` or `error`        | Fetch outcome                     |
| `error_message`    | VARCHAR(255) | NULLABLE                    | Normalized failure reason         |
| `raw_response`     | LONGTEXT     | NULLABLE                    | Successful upstream JSON response |

Every persisted judgement record SHALL reference an existing fetch log.

### 2.3 Judgement Visibility Request

Table name: `judgement_visibility_request`.

| Column         | Type         | Constraints | Description                                       |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `uid`          | INT UNSIGNED | PRIMARY KEY | Luogu UID whose history an administrator hid      |
| `hidden_until` | INT UNSIGNED | NOT NULL    | Inclusive Luogu event-time cutoff in Unix seconds |
| `created_at`   | DATETIME     | NOT NULL    | First request persistence time                    |
| `updated_at`   | DATETIME     | NOT NULL    | Most recent request persistence time              |

The table SHALL contain at most one row for one Luogu UID. It SHALL retain the request independently of the judgement records; neither a visibility request nor a hide operation SHALL delete or modify `judgement_record`, its snapshots, or its fetch-log association.

## 3. Worker Handler Upstream Fetch

The `JudgementHandler` module SHALL request the fixed URL `https://www.luogu.com.cn/judgement` itself with:

1. Method `GET`.
2. Header `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest`.
3. Header `Referer` equal to `https://www.luogu.com.cn/judgement`.
4. Browser-compatible `Accept`, `Accept-Language`, `Cache-Control`, `Pragma`, and `User-Agent` headers.
5. Timeout `config.network.timeout`.
6. Automatic response decompression.
7. Redirects disabled.
8. A maximum response size of 10 MiB.

Only HTTP 2xx responses SHALL be accepted. The response SHALL be JSON with a `logs` array. Every log SHALL contain a positive integer `user.uid`, non-empty `user.name`, non-negative integer permission fields, and a positive integer Unix timestamp. The numeric fields stored in unsigned 32-bit columns (`user.uid`, permission fields, and timestamp) SHALL NOT exceed `4294967295`. Additional upstream fields SHALL be preserved in the JSON snapshots.

Upstream failure reasons SHALL NOT contain response bodies, cookies, HTML pages, or judgement snapshots.

## 4. Synchronization Persistence Service

`JudgementService.persistFetchedResult(result)` SHALL accept one already fetched and schema-validated upstream result containing `data` and `rawResponse`.

The method SHALL:

1. In one database transaction, create a successful fetch log and insert each non-duplicate judgement record.
2. Store the successful raw JSON response in the fetch log for forensic recovery.
3. Set `newRecordCount` to the number of judgement records whose `fetch_log_id` equals the new fetch log ID after the duplicate-safe insert.
4. Set `skippedCount` to the upstream log count minus `newRecordCount`.
5. Return `fetchLogId`, `fetchedCount`, `newRecordCount`, and `skippedCount`.

`JudgementService.recordFetchFailure(reason)` SHALL persist one error fetch log with zero counts, no raw response, and the supplied normalized reason. This method SHALL execute outside any failed successful-fetch transaction.

The persistence service SHALL not perform upstream HTTP requests or response validation. Runtime logs SHALL contain counts and identifiers but SHALL NOT contain raw responses or snapshots.

## 5. HTTP API

### 5.1 Common Pagination and Validation

`page` SHALL be a positive integer with default `1`. `limit` SHALL be an integer from `1` through `500` with default `50`. Invalid query values SHALL produce application error code `400`.

### 5.2 GET /judgement

The endpoint SHALL accept these optional filters:

| Query        | Meaning                                                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `uid`        | Comma-separated unique positive user IDs                              |
| `name`       | Trimmed literal substring, maximum 100 characters                     |
| `reason`     | Trimmed literal substring, maximum 200 characters                     |
| `start_time` | Positive Unix second; record time must be greater than or equal to it |
| `end_time`   | Positive Unix second; record time must be less than or equal to it    |
| `rev_perm`   | Comma-separated positive bit masks, all of which must be set          |
| `add_perm`   | Comma-separated positive bit masks, all of which must be set          |
| `no_perm`    | Exact value `1` requires both permission fields to equal zero         |

All supplied filters SHALL be combined with AND. `%`, `_`, and the SQL escape character in `name` and `reason` SHALL be treated literally. An omitted time boundary SHALL leave that side of the interval unbounded. If both time boundaries are supplied, `start_time` SHALL NOT exceed `end_time`. Each supplied time boundary SHALL NOT exceed `4294967295`. Results SHALL be ordered by `time DESC, id DESC`.

For a record whose `time` is less than or equal to `hidden_until` in the matching visibility-request row, the endpoint SHALL retain its UID, name, user snapshot, event time, fetch-log metadata, and creation time; return `hidden: true`; return `reason: "此记录已被账号所有者要求隐藏"`; and return both permission fields as `0`. It SHALL NOT return `full_record`.

For every other record, the endpoint SHALL return `hidden: false` and its persisted display fields. The endpoint SHALL call `ctx.success` with list-item fields:

```typescript
{
    items: Array<{
        id: number;
        uid: number;
        name: string;
        reason: string | null;
        revoked_permission: number;
        added_permission: number;
        time: number;
        user: Record<string, unknown>;
        fetch_log_id: number;
        log_fetched_at: Date | null;
        created_at: Date;
        hidden: boolean;
    }>;
    pagination: {
        page: number;
        limit: number;
        total: number;
        totalPages: number;
    }
}
```

The endpoint SHALL NOT return `full_record`. The `full_record` database column SHALL remain the complete immutable upstream snapshot for persistence and forensic recovery. The list query SHALL NOT select the `full_record` column from the database.

### 5.3 POST /admin/judgements/hide

The endpoint SHALL require `Permission.MANAGE_CONTENT`. The request body SHALL be `{ uids: string }`.

`uids` SHALL contain one or more decimal positive Luogu UIDs, separated by commas, CRLF, or LF. Whitespace surrounding a UID is ignored. Empty segments caused by consecutive separators are ignored. Every UID SHALL be an integer from `1` through `4294967295`. Duplicate UIDs SHALL be processed once in first-occurrence order. Any invalid non-empty segment, an empty result, or a non-string body field SHALL produce application error code `400`.

On each request, the service SHALL set every submitted UID's `hidden_until` to the current Unix second, creating a visibility-request row when absent. An update SHALL retain the greater of the stored cutoff and the current Unix second. The response SHALL be `{ items: Array<{ uid: number; hiddenUntil: number }> }`, in normalized input order.

The operation applies to every current and later-read record for each submitted UID with an event time not later than its `hiddenUntil`; it SHALL not support selecting individual records. A record with an event time after the cutoff, including a record first fetched after this request, SHALL remain visible unless a later administrator request advances the cutoff.

The public judgement page SHALL NOT expose an account-owner deletion or hiding action. The administrator console SHALL expose a `MANAGE_CONTENT`-guarded control that accepts comma- or newline-separated UIDs and invokes this endpoint.

For a returned item with `hidden: true`, the judgement list SHALL preserve the UID, avatar, username, and time; render `—` for permission changes; and render the API-supplied placeholder reason. The user-profile judgement timeline SHALL preserve its time and other record layout, omit permission-change tags, and render the API-supplied placeholder reason.

### 5.4 GET /judgement/logs

This endpoint SHALL use common pagination, order by `id DESC`, and return fetch-log metadata without `raw_response`.

### 5.5 GET /judgement/stats

This endpoint SHALL return `totalJudgements`, `totalFetchLogs`, `lastFetchAt`, and `lastFetchStatus`.

## 6. Queue Handler and Scheduler

`JudgementHandler` SHALL register exact task key `save:judgement`. It SHALL accept only `targetId = "latest"`, perform the upstream fetch and response validation in the handler module, pass the validated result to `JudgementService.persistFetchedResult()`, and return the synchronization counts.

If the upstream request, response validation, or persistence fails, the handler SHALL normalize the failure reason, call `JudgementService.recordFetchFailure()` once, and rethrow the normalized error. Failure-log persistence errors SHALL be logged without replacing the original task failure.

The scheduler SHALL dispatch once during backend startup and then dispatch every 1200000 milliseconds. It SHALL create and dispatch a save task with target `judgement` and target ID `latest`.

Before dispatch, the scheduler SHALL acquire a Redis lock with `SET NX PX` so multiple backend processes do not enqueue the same scheduled run. The lock TTL SHALL equal 1200000 milliseconds. If task creation or dispatch fails, the scheduler SHALL release only the lock value it owns. Its timer SHALL call `unref()`.

The judgement source URL, scheduling enablement, startup run, and interval SHALL NOT be read from `config.yml`.

## 7. Frontend Refresh

The judgement list view SHALL request `GET /judgement` when mounted. While the view remains mounted, it SHALL repeat the same request every 60000 milliseconds using the current pagination and filter values. It SHALL stop the timer when unmounted.

## 8. Legacy SQLite Import

The one-time importer SHALL require an explicit SQLite file path and explicit source time-zone offset in `+HH:MM` or `-HH:MM` form.

Before writing, it SHALL validate the required tables and columns, every JSON snapshot, and every record-to-fetch-log reference. It SHALL preserve legacy IDs, snapshots, statuses, fetch-log associations, and timestamps, compute each duplicate key, and use duplicate-safe inserts so rerunning the importer is safe.

If multiple legacy rows map to one normalized duplicate key, the importer SHALL retain the earliest legacy row and count later rows as duplicates. Imported fetch-log new/skipped counts SHALL reflect those retained records.

The importer SHALL print source counts, unique record count, inserted and matched target counts, duplicate count, and minimum/maximum event time. It SHALL exit non-zero when the target does not contain every source duplicate key after import. The deployed import command SHALL run against the already compiled backend and SHALL NOT require development dependencies.

The importer SHALL run as a standalone process that initializes the database but does not start the judgement scheduler. It SHALL NOT require a judgement scheduling section in `config.yml`. The backend process SHALL be stopped while the importer writes to the target database. The legacy database file and credentials SHALL NOT be committed.
