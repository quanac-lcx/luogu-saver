# Article System Specification

## 1. Overview

The article system manages articles archived from Luogu. It provides storage, retrieval, caching, history tracking, and content rendering.

### 3.2 Indexes

- `idx_article_id_version`: (`articleId`, `version`)

## 4. API Endpoints

### 4.1 GET /article/query/:id

Retrieve a single article by ID.

**Request:**

- Path parameter: `id` (string) - Article ID

**Response:**

- 200: Article object with raw `content` and no `renderedContent` field when `deleted = false`
- 200: Article object with raw `content` and no `renderedContent` field when `deleted = true` and `ctx.user.role = ROLE_ADMIN`
- 403: If `deleted = true` and the requester is not an authenticated administrator, returns
  `deleteReason` as error message
- 404: Article not found
- 500: Server error

**Side Effects:**

- Tracks `VIEW_ARTICLE` event if tracking is enabled and `deleted = false`

If `deleted = true` and the requester is an authenticated administrator, the endpoint SHALL return
the stored raw article content and SHALL NOT track `VIEW_ARTICLE`.

If `deleted = true`, the frontend article detail view SHALL:

1. Render the stored article title and content only when the backend returns code `200`.
2. Render the title in `--ui-error-color`.
3. Render one error tag with exact text `已删除` beside the title.
4. Not request related articles or article history.
5. Not render article comments.
6. Not trigger automatic article updates.
7. Hide update and knowledge-base commands.
8. For an authenticated administrator, replace the deletion-request command with one command whose
   label is `恢复` and whose icon is the Lucide `RotateCcw` icon.
9. The restore command SHALL show a confirmation dialog before calling
   `POST /admin/articles/:id/restore`. Canceling SHALL make no request. A successful request SHALL
   reload the current article data.

The deleted-article administrator exception SHALL NOT apply to relevant-article, history, comment,
or comment-refresh endpoints.

### 4.2 GET /article/relevant/:id

Get articles relevant to the specified article.

**Request:**

- Path parameter: `id` (string) - Article ID

**Response:**

- 200: Array of relevant articles with `reason` field
- 403: If source article `deleted = true`, returns `deleteReason` as error message
- 404: Source article not found
- 500: Server error

### 4.3 GET /article/history/:id

Get version history of an article.

**Request:**

- Path parameter: `id` (string) - Article ID

**Response:**

- 200: Array of `ArticleHistory` entries ordered by version ASC
- 403: If article `deleted = true`, returns `deleteReason` as error message
- 404: Article not found
- 500: Server error

### 4.4 GET /article/recent

Get recently updated articles.

**Request:**

- Query parameters:
    - `count` (number, optional): Maximum articles to return (default: 20, max: 100)
    - `updated_after` (string, optional): ISO date string to filter articles updated after
    - `truncated_count` (number, optional): Max content length (default: 200, max: 600)

**Response:**

- 200: Array of articles with truncated content
- 500: Server error

### 4.5 GET /article/count

Get total count of non-deleted articles.

**Response:**

- 200: `{ count: number }`
- 500: Server error

## 5. Service Layer

### 5.1 ArticleService

| Method                                | Cache TTL | Cache Key Pattern                             |
| ------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `getArticleById(id)`                  | 600s      | `article:${id}`                               |
| `getRecentArticles(count, after)`     | 600s      | `article:recent:${count}:${after?.getTime()}` |
| `getArticleCount()`                   | 600s      | `article:count`                               |
| `saveArticle(article)`                | evicts    | `article:${id}`, `article:count`              |
| `saveLuoguArticle(data, forceUpdate)` | evicts    | `article:${data.lid}`, `article:count`        |

Each ArticleService read/write method that accepts an optional `manager` argument SHALL use that `EntityManager` for database access when it is provided.
When a cached read method receives a manager argument, it SHALL bypass Redis cache reads and writes.

### 5.2 ArticleHistoryService

| Method                             | Cache TTL | Cache Key Pattern              |
| ---------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `getHistoryByArticleId(articleId)` | 600s      | `article_history:${articleId}` |
| `pushNewVersion(articleId, ...)`   | evicts    | `article_history:${articleId}` |

### 5.3 Version Management

When `pushNewVersion` is called:

1. Lock the owning article row by ID and select only its ID.
2. Query only the `version` column from the latest history entry for the article, ordered by version DESC.
3. Calculate `newVersion = latestVersion + 1` (or 1 if no history exists).
4. Create and save a new `ArticleHistory` record.
5. Evict the history cache.

If ArticleHistoryService receives an optional `manager` argument, it SHALL use that `EntityManager` for database access.
When a cached read method receives a manager argument, it SHALL bypass Redis cache reads and writes.

## 6. Raw Markdown Delivery

### 6.1 Single Article Query

After `GET /article/query/:id` obtains a viewable article, the endpoint SHALL:

1. Return the stored `article.content` string without modification.
2. Not add a `renderedContent` field.
3. Not invoke `@luogu-saver/markdown-renderer`, `RendererService`, or any equivalent renderer.

### 6.2 Recent Article Query

For each article selected by `GET /article/recent`, the endpoint SHALL:

1. Not invoke a Markdown renderer.
2. Apply `truncated_count` only to the response `content` field.
3. Not add a `renderedContent` field.

The frontend SHALL render every article `content` value that it displays.

## 7. Content Hashing

When saving an article:

1. Compute `SHA-256(content)` as hex string.
2. Read only `id`, `title`, and `contentHash` when checking whether an existing article changed.
3. If hashes match AND titles match, skip the update.
4. For a missing row, attempt the insert before requesting a pessimistic row lock.
5. For an existing or concurrently inserted row, acquire a pessimistic row lock before updating.
6. Retry the complete database transaction at most three times for MariaDB deadlock or lock-wait timeout errors.
7. Otherwise, save the new content and update `contentHash`.
8. After `saveLuoguArticle` returns successfully, delete Redis keys `article:${data.lid}` and `article:count` before returning, including when the result has `skipped=true`.

Article candidate methods used by recommendation SHALL select article IDs only. They SHALL NOT
select `content`, `summary`, or author relations. Full article rows SHALL be loaded only for the
final selected recommendation IDs.

### 7.1 Publish Time Persistence

Let `t = normalizePublishTime(data.time)`, where `normalizePublishTime(v)` returns `v` if `v` is an
integer satisfying `1 <= v <= 4294967295`, and `null` otherwise. The upper bound is the maximum of
the `INT UNSIGNED` column; the lower bound rejects `0`, which Luogu uses for no value.

`saveLuoguArticle(data, forceUpdate)` SHALL write `t` into `publish_time` on the insert of step 4 and
on the update of step 7. If `t` is `null`, `publish_time` SHALL be absent from both write payloads,
so that a malformed `time` neither inserts nor overwrites a value.

Step 3 returns without writing, so a row whose stored `contentHash` and `title` both match the
incoming values keeps whatever `publish_time` it already had, including `NULL` for a row inserted
before this column existed. When step 3 skips and `t` is not `null`, `saveLuoguArticle` SHALL
therefore execute exactly one additional statement, inside the transaction that already holds the
pessimistic lock of step 5:

```sql
UPDATE article SET publish_time = :t WHERE id = :id AND publish_time IS NULL
```

That statement SHALL leave `updated_at` unchanged, SHALL NOT create an `article_history` version,
and SHALL affect zero rows once `publish_time` is set. It is therefore idempotent, and repeating a
skipped save does not move the article in any ordering by `updated_at`.

`publish_time` SHALL NOT be written from any source other than the `time` field of the Luogu article
payload.

## 8. Invariants

1. `version` numbers are strictly monotonically increasing per article.
2. Non-deleted articles (`deleted = false`) are returned in queries unless explicitly filtered.
3. All article queries include the `author` relation.
4. Content truncation preserves UTF-8 character boundaries.
5. `publish_time` and `created_at` denote different instants and SHALL NOT be substituted for one
   another. `publish_time` is the instant Luogu reports for the article itself; `created_at` is the
   instant this system first persisted the row. For an article archived long after publication the
   two differ without bound.
6. `publish_time` is `NULL` if and only if no save has yet observed a Luogu `time` that
   `normalizePublishTime` accepts for that article. It is never `0` and never derived from
   `created_at`.
7. Writing `publish_time` into a row that stored `NULL` is not an update of the archived article.
   It SHALL NOT advance `updated_at`, because `updated_at` orders `GET /article/recent` of section
   4.4 and is read by clients as the instant the archived content last changed.

## 9. Summary Rebuild Workflow

The workflow template `article-summary-rebuild-pipeline` SHALL rebuild summaries for all non-deleted articles.

Input parameters:

| Parameter     | Type   | Required | Default | Constraint            |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ------- | --------------------- |
| `batchSize`   | number | no       | 20      | Integer in `[1, 100]` |
| `concurrency` | number | no       | 5       | Integer in `[1, 20]`  |

Task `rebuild-summary` SHALL:

1. Have type `update`.
2. Have target `article_summary_rebuild`.
3. Have `targetId='articles'`.
4. Have `metadata.batchSize` equal to normalized `batchSize`.
5. Have `metadata.concurrency` equal to normalized `concurrency`.
6. Set `track=true`.
7. Set `report=true`.
8. Require permission `MANAGE_SEARCH`.

The update handler for `article_summary_rebuild` SHALL:

1. Load non-deleted articles from the database in ascending `id` order.
2. Process each loaded batch with at most `metadata.concurrency` articles running at the same time.
3. For each article, call the summary LLM scenario with the same summary prompt semantics as `llm:summary`.
4. Persist the generated summary to `article.summary`.
5. After persisting a summary, update the search index document for that article if search indexing is enabled.
6. Continue processing if one article fails and record that article ID in `failedArticleIds`.
7. Return `{ processed, updated, failed, failedArticleIds }`.

## 10. Embedding Rebuild Workflow

The workflow template `article-embedding-rebuild-pipeline` SHALL rebuild Chroma embeddings for all non-deleted articles.

Input parameters:

| Parameter     | Type   | Required | Default | Constraint            |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ------- | --------------------- |
| `batchSize`   | number | no       | 20      | Integer in `[1, 100]` |
| `concurrency` | number | no       | 5       | Integer in `[1, 50]`  |

Task `rebuild-embedding` SHALL:

1. Have type `update`.
2. Have target `article_embedding_rebuild`.
3. Have `targetId='articles'`.
4. Have `metadata.batchSize` equal to normalized `batchSize`.
5. Have `metadata.concurrency` equal to normalized `concurrency`.
6. Set `track=true`.
7. Set `report=true`.
8. Require permission `MANAGE_SEARCH`.

The update handler for `article_embedding_rebuild` SHALL:

1. Load non-deleted articles from the database in ascending `id` order.
2. Process each loaded batch with at most `metadata.concurrency` articles running at the same time.
3. For each article, call the embedding LLM scenario with `article.summary` when it is a non-empty string, otherwise with `article.content`; upsert that vector as the summary vector.
4. For each article, split `article.content` into chunks of 4000 characters with 300 characters overlap; call the embedding LLM scenario for each chunk; upsert each chunk vector.
5. Before inserting chunk vectors for an article, delete existing Chroma chunk vectors with metadata `articleId=article.id` and `kind="chunk"`.
6. Summary vectors SHALL use ID `article.id`; chunk vectors SHALL use ID `${article.id}:chunk:${index}`.
7. Vector metadata SHALL include `{ articleId, kind, title, authorId, category, tags, deleted }` where
   `deleted=article.deleted`; chunk vectors SHALL also include `{ chunkIndex, start, end }`.
8. The Chroma metadata field `tags` SHALL be a comma-separated string built from `article.tags`.
9. Continue processing if one article fails and record that article ID in `failedArticleIds`.
10. Return `{ processed, updated, failed, failedArticleIds }`.

The update handler for `article_embedding` SHALL:

1. Read the article from the database by `targetId`.
2. If upstream summary output contains non-empty `data.summary`, use that value for the summary vector document.
3. If upstream summary output is absent, use `article.summary` when non-empty, otherwise `article.content`.
4. Split `article.content` into chunks and upsert chunk vectors as specified for `article_embedding_rebuild`.
5. Not modify `article.content` or any article row.
