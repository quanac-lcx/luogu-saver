# Workflow System Specification

## 1. Scope

This specification defines backend workflow orchestration behavior implemented under `packages/backend`.

A workflow definition is a logical DAG of task definitions. The backend stores every workflow node as a `task` row and executes ready nodes as independent BullMQ jobs. The backend, not BullMQ Flow, owns DAG scheduling.

The `fathers` field defines task readiness and upstream data visibility. A task is ready when every named father task has completed successfully.

Redis stores workflow runtime keys for dispatch acceleration. The database is the durable source of truth. For every non-terminal workflow, the backend MUST be able to reconstruct Redis runtime keys from `workflow` and `task` rows after a process restart.

### 1.1 Responsibility Boundaries

1. `WorkflowService` SHALL own workflow definition validation, task ID generation, queue capacity checks, transactional SQL creation, deduplication descriptors, and SQL-backed workflow queries.
2. `WorkflowRuntimeStore` SHALL own Redis runtime key generation, initialization and reconstruction from SQL rows, reads, writes, deletion, release-once markers, father counters, and upstream result loading with SQL fallback. Graph construction and stored-result normalization SHALL remain private to this store.
3. `WorkflowScheduler` SHALL own task dispatch, SQL-backed readiness checks, descendant release, and ready-task dispatch during recovery. `FlowManager` SHALL retain worker completion/failure synchronization, tracked SQL results, terminal workflow status writes, and batched restart recovery. Recovery SHALL call the same completion/failure synchronization methods as worker events.
4. `WorkflowScheduler` MAY call `WorkflowRuntimeStore`. `WorkflowRuntimeStore` MUST NOT import the scheduler, queue factory, or worker orchestration modules.
5. `WorkflowCleanupService` SHALL delete runtime keys through `WorkflowRuntimeStore`. Task processors SHALL load father results through `WorkflowRuntimeStore`. `FlowManager` SHALL use the runtime store for result persistence and runtime reconstruction, and the scheduler for descendant release and ready-task dispatch.
6. These boundaries SHALL use workflow-specific methods. They SHALL NOT introduce a generic orchestration framework or forwarding compatibility modules.

## 2. Workflow Entity

Table name: `workflow`

| Column        | Type     | Constraints       | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`          | UUID     | PRIMARY KEY       | Workflow identifier exposed as `workflowId` in API responses |
| `root_job_id` | VARCHAR  | NULLABLE          | Legacy BullMQ Flow root job ID. New DAG workflows set `null` |
| `queue_name`  | VARCHAR  | NULLABLE          | Legacy BullMQ Flow root queue. New DAG workflows set `null`  |
| `status`      | VARCHAR  | DEFAULT `pending` | Last known workflow status                                   |
| `definition`  | JSON     | NOT NULL          | Normalized workflow definition                               |
| `result`      | JSON     | NULLABLE          | Tracked task result map                                      |
| `created_at`  | DATETIME | NOT NULL          | Creation time                                                |
| `updated_at`  | DATETIME | NOT NULL          | Last update time                                             |

The workflow table SHALL define these indexes:

1. `idx_workflow_status_created_at_id` over `(status, created_at, id)`.
2. `idx_workflow_status_updated_at_id` over `(status, updated_at, id)`.

The `workflow_deduplication` table SHALL contain:

1. `key VARCHAR(191)` as its primary key.
2. `workflow_id VARCHAR(36)` as a unique foreign key to `workflow.id` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
3. `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps.

## 3. Workflow Definition

The API accepts exactly this JSON shape:

```json
{
    "tasks": [
        {
            "name": "save",
            "track": true,
            "report": true,
            "fathers": [],
            "data": {
                "type": "save",
                "payload": {}
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Validation rules enforced by `validateFlowStructure`:

1. The workflow definition MUST be an object and MUST NOT be an array.
2. `tasks` MUST be a non-empty array.
3. Each task MUST have `name` as a truthy string. A whitespace-only string is accepted because no trim check is performed.
4. Each task name MUST be unique by exact string equality.
5. If `report` is present on a task, it MUST be a boolean.
6. If `fathers` is present, it MUST be an array.
7. Every father entry MUST exactly match one task name in the same `tasks` array.
8. The logical graph defined by `fathers` MUST be acyclic.

Validation rules not enforced by `validateFlowStructure`:

1. `track` is not type-checked.
2. `data` is not checked for presence or object type.
3. `data.type` is not checked against the task type enum.
4. `data.payload` is not checked for presence or object type.
5. `data.payload.target` is not checked for presence or string type.

Runtime semantics:

1. `track = true` means the task completion payload is written into `workflow.result[taskName]`.
2. `report = true` means the task emits websocket completion/failure events for clients that join `task:{taskId}`.
3. `track` and `report` are independent. A task MAY be tracked but not reported, or reported but not tracked.

## 4. API Endpoints

### 4.1 POST `/workflow/create`

Permission requirement: `CREATE_WORKFLOW`.

Input: normalized workflow definition object as specified in section 3.

If workflow creation throws, including validation errors, the HTTP endpoint catches the error and returns code `500` through `ctx.fail`.

Output:

```json
{
    "workflowId": "<uuid>",
    "taskIds": {
        "<taskName>": "<16_char_task_id>"
    },
    "reportTaskIds": {
        "<reportTaskName>": "<16_char_task_id>"
    },
    "trackTaskIds": {
        "<trackTaskName>": "<16_char_task_id>"
    },
    "deduplicated": false
}
```

Postconditions:

1. A `workflow` row is created with `id = workflowId`, `status = 'active'`, `root_job_id = null`, and `queue_name = null`.
2. `workflow.definition` stores the accepted workflow definition.
3. `workflow.result` contains one key for every task with `track = true`; every initial value is `null`.
4. For every item in `tasks`, one `task` row is created before any BullMQ job is added.
5. Each workflow task row has `workflow_id = workflowId`, `task_name = task.name`, `type = task.data.type`, `payload = task.data.payload`, `status = PENDING`, and `priority` equal to the workflow creation option `priority`.
6. Each task ID in `taskIds` is a 16-character random string.
7. Each BullMQ job ID equals the corresponding `task.id`.
8. The backend initializes Redis runtime state for every workflow task before adding entrypoint jobs.
9. A task with no fathers is an entrypoint task.
10. Only entrypoint tasks are added to BullMQ during workflow creation.
11. Each added BullMQ job name equals the workflow task name.
12. Each added BullMQ job stores complete task execution data: `id`, `type`, `payload`, `workflowId`, `taskName`, `track`, `report`, `fathers`, and `fatherIds`.
13. Each added BullMQ job SHALL set `priority` equal to the workflow creation option `priority`.
14. If the workflow is created from an HTTP workflow API endpoint, the creation option `priority` SHALL be `1`.
15. `reportTaskIds` contains exactly the task-name subset whose task definition has `report = true`.
16. `trackTaskIds` contains exactly the task-name subset whose task definition has `track = true`.
17. If workflow creation fails before the API response is sent, no `workflow` row with `id = workflowId` and no `task` rows with `workflow_id = workflowId` remain in the database.

### 4.2 POST `/workflow/create/template/:name`

Input: template parameter object.

Permission model:

1. The template name must exist in `WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES_PERMISSION`.
2. If mapped permission is `null`, the endpoint is public and does not require login.
3. If mapped permission is non-null, requester must be authenticated and satisfy the mapped permission bit.

Output format is identical to section 4.1.

Workflows created by this endpoint SHALL use creation option `priority = 1`.

For BullMQ priorities, a smaller positive integer is higher priority than a larger positive integer.

### 4.3 GET `/workflow/query/:id`

Input path parameter: workflow UUID.

Output:

```json
{
    "workflowId": "<uuid>",
    "status": "pending|active|completed|failed|expired|...",
    "createdAt": "<datetime>",
    "updatedAt": "<datetime>",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "taskId": "<task_id>",
            "taskName": "<task_name>",
            "status": "pending|processing|completed|failed|missing",
            "type": "<task_type>",
            "target": "<task_target>",
            "fathers": ["<father_task_name>"],
            "fatherIds": {
                "<father_task_name>": "<father_task_id>"
            },
            "track": true,
            "report": false,
            "info": "<task_status_info>"
        }
    ],
    "result": {
        "<trackedTaskName>": {
            "name": "<result_name>",
            "result": "<result_payload>"
        }
    }
}
```

The query endpoint reads workflow and task state from the database. Missing Redis runtime keys MUST NOT make the query endpoint return `expired`.
For tracked task entries that are not finished yet, `result[taskName]` is `null`.
For every returned task, `fathers` equals the task definition `fathers` array or `[]` when omitted.
For every returned task, `fatherIds` maps each father task name to the corresponding SQL task ID when that task row exists.
For every returned task, `type`, `target`, `track`, and `report` are read from the workflow definition, not from Redis runtime state.
For every returned task with `status = "failed"`, `info` is normalized by `task-queue.spec.md` failure reason normalization and has length at most 80 characters.

14. The final answer SHALL NOT expose chain-of-thought text. It SHALL contain only the answer content.

Permission: `CREATE_WORKFLOW`.

LLM task handlers SHALL consume upstream `data.text` only. LLM task handlers SHALL NOT read external source objects by `sourceId`.

Read task handlers SHALL be the only task handlers that load article or paste content from persistent storage for workflow data flow.

## 6. Status, Result, and Report Synchronization

1. Each workflow job updates the `task` row whose `id` equals the BullMQ job ID.
2. Only report tasks emit websocket events `task:{taskId}:completed` and `task:{taskId}:failed`.
3. A report task completed event payload SHALL contain `status='completed'` and `result=returnvalue.__result`.
4. A report task failed event payload SHALL contain `status='failed'` and `error`.
5. A report task failed event `error` SHALL be normalized by `task-queue.spec.md` failure reason normalization and have length at most 80 characters.
6. Non-report workflow tasks do not emit `task:{taskId}` websocket events.
7. Legacy non-workflow tasks emit websocket task events for every completed or failed task.
8. When a workflow task completes successfully, its `task.result` stores the full processor return value.
9. When a workflow task completes successfully, its direct descendant counters are released exactly once.
10. A descendant task is added to BullMQ when every father task has `status = COMPLETED` and the descendant task status is neither `COMPLETED` nor `FAILED`.
11. Workflow completion status is set to `completed` when every task row with `workflow_id = workflowId` has `status = COMPLETED`.
12. Workflow failure status is set to `failed` when any workflow task reaches final failure.
13. After workflow status becomes `failed`, no new descendant tasks for that workflow SHALL be added by workflow scheduling code.
14. For tracked tasks (`track = true`), when a job includes `workflowId` and `taskName`, its return payload is merged into `workflow.result[taskName]`.
15. Result payload is normalized as:

```json
{
    "name": "<returnvalue.__name>",
    "result": "<returnvalue.__result>"
}
```

16. Status writes are monotonic with respect to terminal states.
17. If current `workflow.status` is `completed`, `failed`, or `expired`, later queue status reads, worker events, recovery passes, or queue events MUST NOT replace it.
18. If current `workflow.status` is not terminal, worker events or recovery passes MAY replace it with `active`, `completed`, or `failed`.

## 7. Runtime Redis Keys

For each workflow task ID `taskId`, the runtime store MAY create these Redis keys:

1. `workflow:task:def:{taskId}` stores the complete BullMQ job data and priority for the task.
2. `workflow:task:counter:{taskId}` stores the number of incomplete father tasks.
3. `workflow:task:descendants:{taskId}` stores an array of direct descendant task IDs.
4. `workflow:task:result:{taskId}` stores `returnvalue.__result` after successful completion.
5. `workflow:task:released:{taskId}` stores a marker that descendant counters were released for `taskId`.

Runtime keys for active workflows SHALL NOT require a fixed expiration time. Runtime keys SHALL be deleted after the workflow reaches a terminal status. The scheduled workflow cleanup pass SHALL also delete runtime keys for terminal workflows before deleting SQL rows.

Redis operation order SHALL remain:

1. Initialization SHALL process tasks in definition order in one transaction pipeline. For each task, write definition, incomplete-father counter, and descendants in that order. For a completed task, write the release marker and then its normalized result when present; otherwise delete its release marker and result in that order.
2. Descendant release SHALL claim the source task marker with `SET ... NX` before reading descendants. It SHALL decrement descendants in stored order. A negative counter SHALL be reset to zero before checking SQL father status and dispatching that descendant. An existing release marker SHALL prevent all decrements.
3. Cleanup SHALL process task IDs in caller order in one transaction pipeline, deleting definition, counter, descendants, result, and release marker in that order for each task.
4. Upstream result loading SHALL preserve `Object.entries(task.fatherIds)` order. A Redis result SHALL take precedence over SQL fallback. Stored results SHALL unwrap `__result` first, then `{ name, result }`, and otherwise remain unchanged.

## 8. Restart Recovery

On worker startup, the backend SHALL start workflow recovery in the background. HTTP server startup SHALL NOT wait for recovery to complete.

The recovery process SHALL run in batches:

1. Each batch SHALL load at most `config.workflow.recovery.batchSize` workflows whose status is `pending` or `active`.
2. At most `config.workflow.recovery.concurrency` workflows SHALL be recovered concurrently.
3. If another recovery pass is already running, a new recovery pass SHALL NOT start.
4. If `config.workflow.recovery.enabled = false`, startup recovery SHALL NOT run.

For each workflow selected by recovery:

1. Load every task row with `workflow_id = workflow.id`.
2. Rebuild Redis runtime keys from `workflow.definition`, task rows, task statuses, task results, and task priorities.
3. For each completed task row with a stored result, restore `workflow:task:result:{taskId}`.
4. For each completed task row, create `workflow:task:released:{taskId}` because rebuilt counters already exclude completed fathers.
5. If any workflow task row has `status = FAILED`, set the workflow status to `failed`.
6. If every workflow task row has `status = COMPLETED`, set the workflow status to `completed`.
7. For every non-terminal task whose BullMQ job exists and is `completed`, store its return value, mark the task `COMPLETED`, update tracked workflow result when applicable, and release descendants.
8. For every non-terminal task whose BullMQ job exists and is `failed`, mark the task `FAILED` and set the workflow status to `failed`.
9. For every task whose fathers are all completed, whose task row is not terminal, and whose BullMQ job is missing, add the task to BullMQ with `jobId = task.id`.
10. For every task whose BullMQ job already exists in `waiting`, `delayed`, `prioritized`, or `active`, recovery MUST NOT add a duplicate job.
11. If recovery for one workflow throws an error, set that workflow status to `failed` and continue recovery for the remaining workflows.

Recovery is idempotent. Running recovery more than once without new task completions MUST NOT enqueue more than one BullMQ job for the same task ID.

## 9. SQL and Redis Cleanup

The backend SHALL run a scheduled workflow cleanup pass when `config.workflow.cleanup.enabled = true`.

Each cleanup pass SHALL:

1. Select at most `config.workflow.cleanup.batchSize` workflows where `status IN ('completed', 'failed', 'expired')` and `updated_at < now - config.workflow.cleanup.terminalRetentionMs`.
2. For each selected workflow, load task IDs where `task.workflow_id = workflow.id`.
3. Delete Redis runtime keys for those task IDs.
4. Delete SQL task rows where `task.workflow_id = workflow.id`.
5. Delete the SQL workflow row.
6. Delete at most `config.workflow.cleanup.batchSize` non-workflow task rows where `workflow_id IS NULL`, `status IN (COMPLETED, FAILED)`, and `updated_at < now - config.workflow.cleanup.legacyTaskRetentionMs`.

Cleanup SHALL NOT delete non-terminal workflow rows. Cleanup SHALL NOT delete workflow task rows independently of their owning workflow row.

If one workflow cleanup fails, the cleanup pass SHALL log the error and continue with remaining selected workflows.

### 9.1 Workflow Deduplication

When workflow creation receives a non-empty deduplication key:

1. Workflow row creation, task row creation, and deduplication-row insertion SHALL execute in one transaction.
2. If the key does not exist, the new deduplication row SHALL reference the new workflow.
3. If the key already exists, the new workflow transaction SHALL roll back and workflow creation SHALL return the existing workflow descriptor with `deduplicated=true`.
4. An article save template SHALL use key `article-save:${targetId}`.
5. A paste save template SHALL use key `paste-save:${targetId}`.
6. When a workflow reaches `completed`, `failed`, or `expired`, its deduplication row SHALL be deleted.
7. Deleting a workflow row SHALL delete its deduplication row through the foreign key.
8. A deduplicated caller SHALL receive the existing `workflowId`, `taskIds`, `reportTaskIds`, and `trackTaskIds`.
9. A newly created descriptor SHALL contain `deduplicated=false`; an existing descriptor SHALL contain `deduplicated=true`.

## 10. Debug Logging

The backend SHALL write structured workflow logs that allow one workflow run to be reconstructed from log records:

1. Workflow creation logs SHALL include `workflowId`, `priority`, `taskCount`, `entryPointIds`, `reportTaskIds`, and `trackTaskIds`.
2. Runtime initialization logs SHALL include one entry per task with `workflowId`, `taskId`, `taskName`, `type`, `queueName`, `fathers`, `fatherIds`, `descendantIds`, `incompleteFatherCount`, `track`, `report`, and `priority`.
3. Task dispatch logs SHALL include `workflowId`, `taskId`, `taskName`, `type`, `queueName`, `priority`, and `reason`.
4. Upstream data loading logs SHALL include `workflowId`, `taskId`, `taskName`, `fatherNames`, `redisHitCount`, `dbHitCount`, and `missingFatherNames`.
5. Task completion logs SHALL include `workflowId`, `taskId`, `taskName`, `track`, `report`, `changed`, and `resultKeys`.
6. Descendant release logs SHALL include `workflowId`, `taskId`, `taskName`, `descendantIds`, each descendant counter value after decrement, and `dispatchedTaskIds`.
7. Workflow recovery logs SHALL include `workflowId`, `taskCount`, `pendingCount`, `processingCount`, `completedCount`, `failedCount`, and every recovered BullMQ job state that changes task or workflow state.
8. Workflow query logs SHALL include `workflowId`, `status`, `taskCount`, and counts by task status.
9. Debug logs SHALL NOT include full workflow result payloads, full embeddings, article bodies, paste bodies, or LLM prompt text.

## 11. Invariants

1. `workflowId` is the only workflow identifier accepted by `/workflow/query/:id`.
2. Every value in `taskIds` is both a `task.id` and a BullMQ job ID.
3. `reportTaskIds` contains exactly the task-name subset whose task definition has `report = true`.
4. `trackTaskIds` contains exactly the task-name subset whose task definition has `track = true`.
5. Template permission lookup is exact-key based; missing keys are rejected as invalid templates.
